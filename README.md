Forecasting Air Quality in Delhi

Air quality in Delhi poses serious risks to the population. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has been utilized by numerous researchers to analyze and forecast air quality levels. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze daily AQI observation data in Delhi starting from 2015 and to determine the algorithm with the highest predictive capability. We tested an ARIMA model, an exponential model, and a neural network (LSTM). Among these, the LSTM model demonstrated the best predictive capacity for a one-year forecast horizon. This study supports recent research regarding the suitability of LSTM models for time series forecasting. The results obtained serve as a reference point for future studies and may assist policymakers in planning interventions aimed at combating air pollution.
